# CSE_584_midterm

This is the mid-term project for CSE-584 which collects data from different LLMs with truncated texts and builds a classifier to identify which LLM produced the corresponding complete text


Instruction of Code:

data folder - Contains the datasets we constructed from getting_pairs.ipynb, the data stored in three files which are train_df.csv, valid_df.csv, test_df.csv for training, validation, and testing data

getting_pairs.ipynb - Contains the code to get data and store the outputs from LLMs to construct the new dataset for classification task

classifier.ipynb - Contains the code where we trained the classification model and performed the experiments for confusion matrix

Mid-term Project Report.pdf - briefly describe the word we have done and discusses our results with related works
